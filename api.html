Hello! You have found the API page. Here are your instructions to see everything this API does.
<p></p>
<p></p>
To find things in the InvTypes database. the following URl is provided as;<p></p>
/api/InvTypes/s/NUMBER<p></p>
for example<p></p>
<a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:3000/api/InvTypes/i/2161">/api/InvTypes/i/2161</a> brings us to the Crucifier. Notice the i in the URL? That means ID<p></p>
<p></p>
Now to get the Ship directly. It's very case sensitive!<p></p>
<p></p>
<a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:3000/api/InvTypes/s/Crucifier">/api/InvTypes/s/Crucifier<a> brings us the Crucifier BUT with the ship name. Basically for new people that don't know the ID. Notice the s in the URL? That means SHIP.<p></p>
PS. <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:3000/api/InvTypes">/api/InvTypes</a> is slow as fuck as it needs to load the database. So please be patient with it and don't bitch about it. 37k+ it has to read and display. Sooo...
